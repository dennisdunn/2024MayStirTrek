# Intro To MAUI For Makers
 
My name is Dennis Dunn and I'm a retired software developer. I have a ham radio license [AE0TR](https://ae0tr.github.com) and my passion project is [Open CDSI](https://opencdsi.org). Sometimes I make [notes to myself](https://dennisdunn.github.io). Feel free to reach out to me at [ansofive@gmail.com](mailto:ansofive@gmail.com).

## My Stir Trek Journey

In 2018 I gave a talk at Stir Trek about prototyping complicated systems with Node-Red [Design Like Mythbusters - The Play-Doh Nature of Node-Red](https://github.com/dennisdunn/StirTrek2018-design-like-mythbusters).

Last year I fat-fingered my submission during the *Call For Presentations* so nobody got to see my **Planespotting With Node-Red** talk. It would have been legendary!

This year, however, I managed to secure a slot with a talk about Android app development with *.NET MAUI*, the **Multi-Platform App UI** .NET framework from Microsoft.
We'll look at building an app to control *Conways Game of Life* running on a microcontroller.

## What We'll Cover

 I start with the gizmo and how to advertise over *Bluetooth LE* on a **Raspberry Pico W**. The second section of the talk will be about setting up Visual Studio 2022 for cross-platform development. The third part of the talk will cover developing the gizmo configuration app for Android.
